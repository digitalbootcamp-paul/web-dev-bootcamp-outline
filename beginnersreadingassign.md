# Reading Assignments for a beginning web developer

Starting from scratch in the web development industry is going to require a special learning process - you must absorb everything. Reading for an hour a day is a helpful routine to get you up to speed. There are three aspects to explore - code, process, design. Having overview knowledge in all 3 areas is critical in order to understand what others are talking about when they give you a project.

## Code

### HTML5 basics
- [ ] Read through the usage for the new HTML5 elements (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp)

- [ ] Learn what you should have in your HTML document: [HTML boilerplate's HTML documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/5.3.0/dist/doc/html.md)

- [ ] A deeper [Dive into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html)

- [ ] Learn what HTML5 (and CSS3) features you can use now (click on one or two a day) (http://html5please.com/)

### CSS Basics

- [ ] Everyday, click on one of the CSS properties from this list (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) and read about it. I'd recommend the font properties, background properties, float property, and position property before choosing any others.

- [ ] Understand the Bootstrap Grid. Even if you don't use the Bootstrap framework, you'll need to understand how a responsive grid works

- [ ] [MDN's JavaScript basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

- [ ] I'd recommend signing up at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and completing the entire course of the next few months, but pick out a couple of these exercises to do everyday:
(https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript)

- [ ]  http://codeguide.co/
This one could be read in 2 parts - HTML and CSS. Also it’s a guide - meaning it is a list of suggestions on how to do something. They’re not rules, but suggestions.
